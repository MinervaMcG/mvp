<h3 class="mb-10">When you support a talent, you get $TAL rewards</h3>
<p class="w-full lh-lg text-lg mb-5 text-secondary">
  <strong>We know youâ€™ve joined recently but weâ€™ve noticed that you havenâ€™t bought any talent tokens yet. At Talent Protocol, supporters get rewards - so you shouldnâ€™t miss out on that.</strong>
</p>
<p class="w-full lh-lg text-md mb-5 text-secondary">
  The Talent Tokens you purchase now with USD get later converted to $TAL at a discounted price. That means you are effectively buying TAL at a discount, and you know what they say about getting in a project earlyâ€¦
